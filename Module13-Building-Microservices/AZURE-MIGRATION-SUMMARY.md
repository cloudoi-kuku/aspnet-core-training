# Module 13: Azure Migration Summary

## Overview
Module 13 has been completely restructured to focus exclusively on Azure deployment, eliminating the need for local Docker installation on Windows machines.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Azure-First Approach**
- All exercises now deploy directly to Azure Container Apps
- No local Docker or Docker Desktop required
- Students work with real cloud services from the start

### 2. **Simplified Architecture**
- Reduced from 5+ services to just 2 core services (Product and Order)
- Removed complex orchestration (Docker Swarm, Kubernetes)
- Focus on Azure Container Apps' built-in features

### 3. **Updated Exercises**
1. **Exercise 1**: Azure Setup and Overview
   - Set up Azure resources (Resource Group, ACR, Container Apps Environment)
   - Create Azure SQL Database and Application Insights
   - Estimated cost: ~$30/month

2. **Exercise 2**: Building Azure-Ready Services
   - Create cloud-native ASP.NET Core services
   - Configure for Azure SQL and Application Insights
   - Prepare Dockerfiles for container deployment

3. **Exercise 3**: Deploy to Container Apps
   - Push images to Azure Container Registry
   - Deploy services to Container Apps
   - Configure environment variables and monitoring

4. **Exercise 4**: Azure Service Communication
   - Implement Azure Service Bus messaging
   - Add resilience patterns with Polly
   - Configure service-to-service communication

5. **Exercise 5**: Production Features
   - Configure auto-scaling rules
   - Set up health monitoring
   - Implement cost optimization

### 4. **Benefits**
✅ No Docker Desktop licensing issues  
✅ Real cloud experience from day one  
✅ Managed services reduce complexity  
✅ Built-in scaling and monitoring  
✅ Cost-effective with free tier benefits  

### 5. **Prerequisites**
- Azure subscription (free tier works)
- Azure CLI installed
- .NET 8 SDK
- Visual Studio or VS Code

### 6. **Cost Considerations**
- Estimated monthly cost: $15-30 for minimal usage
- Free tier benefits:
  - 180,000 vCPU-seconds free
  - 360,000 GB-seconds free
  - 2 million requests free
- Can scale to zero to save costs

### 7. **Scripts Updated**
Both `launch-exercises.ps1` and `launch-exercises.sh` have been updated to:
- Check for Azure CLI instead of Docker
- Create Azure-specific setup scripts
- Deploy directly to Container Apps
- Use Azure services for all infrastructure needs

## Migration Path for Existing Content
The old Docker-based content has been preserved in:
- `docker-compose.yml` files moved to archive
- Kubernetes manifests moved to advanced section
- Terraform files focused on Azure-only deployment

## Support
For questions or issues with the Azure approach:
1. Check Azure Container Apps documentation
2. Review the updated exercise files
3. Use Azure Portal for troubleshooting
4. Monitor costs with Azure Cost Management
