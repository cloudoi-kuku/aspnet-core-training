## 📚 Module Overview

- Completion of Modules 1-12
- Understanding of ASP.NET Core Web APIs
- Basic knowledge of containers and Docker
- Familiarity with distributed systems concepts

## 🏗️ What Are Microservices?

Microservices architecture is a design approach where applications are built as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each service:

- **Owns its data** and business logic
- **Communicates** via well-defined APIs
- **Can be developed** by different teams
- **Scales independently** based on demand
- **Uses different technologies** if needed

### Benefits:
- 🚀 **Scalability**: Scale individual services independently
- 🔧 **Technology Diversity**: Use different tech stacks per service
- 👥 **Team Independence**: Teams can work autonomously
- 🛡️ **Fault Isolation**: Failures don't cascade across the system
- 📦 **Deployment Independence**: Deploy services separately

### Challenges:
- 🌐 **Network Complexity**: Distributed communication overhead
- 📊 **Data Consistency**: Managing transactions across services
- 🔍 **Observability**: Monitoring distributed systems
- 🔒 **Security**: Securing service-to-service communication
- 🎭 **Testing**: Integration testing across services

## 🎯 Real-World Scenario

**E-Commerce Microservices Platform**

We'll build a realistic e-commerce platform consisting of:

1. **Product Catalog Service**: Manages product information, categories, and inventory
2. **Order Management Service**: Handles order processing, payments, and fulfillment
3. **User Management Service**: Manages user accounts, authentication, and profiles
4. **Notification Service**: Sends emails, SMS, and push notifications
5. **API Gateway**: Single entry point for client applications

Each service will demonstrate different microservices patterns and challenges.

## 🔧 Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites:
```bash
# .NET 8.0 SDK
dotnet --version # Should be 8.0+

# Docker Desktop
docker --version # For containerization

# Optional: Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code
```

### Getting Started:
1. Navigate to the SourceCode folder
2. Follow the setup instructions in each service
3. Use Docker Compose to run the complete system

## 📚 Key Learning Concepts

### **Microservices Patterns:**
- **Decomposition Patterns**: Database per service, Business capability
- **Data Management**: Saga, Event sourcing, CQRS
- **Communication Patterns**: API Gateway, Service mesh
- **Reliability Patterns**: Circuit breaker, Bulkhead, Timeout
- **Security Patterns**: Access token, Service-to-service security

### **Best Practices:**
- Service should be small enough to be maintained by a small team
- Each service should have a single responsibility
- Services should be loosely coupled and highly cohesive
- Design for failure - expect services to fail
- Automate everything - testing, deployment, monitoring

## 🚀 Quick Start
