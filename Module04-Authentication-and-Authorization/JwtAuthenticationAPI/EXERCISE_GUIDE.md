# Exercise 1: JWT Authentication Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ What You Have Built
This script has created a **complete, working JWT authentication system** with all the features from the exercise:

### âœ… Features Implemented:
- **JWT Token Generation**: Secure token creation with user claims and roles
- **User Authentication**: Login and registration endpoints
- **Protected Endpoints**: Secure API endpoints requiring JWT tokens
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Admin, Manager, and User roles with different access levels
- **Interactive Demo**: Web interface for testing authentication
- **Swagger Documentation**: Complete API documentation with JWT support
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses and logging

### ðŸš€ Testing Your API:
1. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

2. **Open Interactive Demo**:
   - Navigate to: `http://localhost:5000`
   - Test login with provided users
   - Try different protected endpoints

3. **Open Swagger UI**:
   - Navigate to: `http://localhost:5000/swagger`
   - Use "Authorize" button to test with JWT tokens

### ðŸ‘¥ Test Users Available:
1. **admin/admin123** - Admin and User roles (full access)
2. **manager/manager123** - Manager and User roles (management access)
3. **user/user123** - User role only (basic access)

### ðŸ§ª Example API Calls:

**Login:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "admin123"}'
```

**Access Protected Endpoint:**
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/secure/public" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN_HERE"
```

**Test Role-Based Access:**
```bash
# Admin-only endpoint (should work with admin token)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/secure/admin" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Try with user token (should fail with 403)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/secure/admin" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer USER_TOKEN"
```

### ðŸŽ“ Key Learning Points:
- **JWT Structure**: Header.Payload.Signature format
- **Claims-Based Authentication**: User information embedded in tokens
- **Middleware Configuration**: Proper order of authentication middleware
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Different access levels for different users
- **Security Best Practices**: Token validation, expiration, and secure storage

### âœ¨ Ready for Exercise 2!
Your JWT authentication system is now complete and ready for Exercise 2, where you will enhance it with more advanced role-based authorization features.
